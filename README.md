The is waste classification CNN model project
In this project, it contains a simple web application that allows users to upload an image and returns the prediction of the image. It helps users to determine whether the item in the image can be recycled or not.
Unfortunately, the original cnn model is too big (140MB) that exceeds the 25MB limit. The model in this package is a simple CNN model for the web application purpose only.
